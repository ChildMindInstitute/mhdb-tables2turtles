1,regulated heat stimulation,,,trm_565a31fa6f444,"The general task design is that a heat stimulus is applied to the skin and the participant rates the experienced sensation on a visual analogue scale. For this task, there are 9 runs. Runs 1,2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are âpassive experienceâ runs, meaning that participants passively experience and rate the heat stimuli.  Run 3 and 7 are âregulationâ runs, meaning that participants can cognitively âincreaseâ (regulate-up) or âdecreaseâ (regulate-down) pain intensity. For complete details, see:

2,2-stage decision task,two-stage decision task,,trm_5667451917a34,"Subjects participate in a two-stage decision task where they make a binary choice in each stage (stage 1&2) and probabilistically receive reward after the final stage (stage 2). First-stage choices are primarily associated with one of two second-stages (labeled 2a and 2b): one first-stage choice leads to 2a 70% of the time and 2b 30% of the time, while the opposite is true of the other first-stage choice. Each second-stage choice has its own probability of reward (constantly changing via a random-walk). The ultimate goal of the subject is to maximize reward, which are only given during the second stage. The ideal subject would identify the most rewarding second-stage stimulus and make first-stage choices that make it more likely to arrive at the relevant second stage. "

7,incentive modulated antisaccade task,,,trm_565a2e79b22f2,"The basic antisaccade task is as follows:

Subjects view a fixation point and a visual target is presented.  Subjects are instructed to make a saccade away from the target (antisaccade).

For this version (from Figure 1 of http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929311000612)

At the onset of each AS trial, participants were first presented with one of two incentive cues (1500 ms) (Fig. 1). For rewarded trials, the cue consisted of three rectangles containing dollar signs ($ $ $), indicating that money could be earned on that trial if correctly performed. Participants were told that they could win up to US $25 based on their performance during the task. However, they did not know how much they could win on any given trial in order to prevent them from keeping a running tally of their earnings and invoking processes (i.e. working memory) separate from inhibitory control and reward processing. For neutral trials, the three consecutive rectangles each contained a dash (â â â), which indicated that no monetary gain was at stake for that trial. After the initial cue, a central red fixation cross subtending â¼0.7Â° of visual angle appeared (3000 ms), instructing participants to prepare for the target stimulus. The red central fixation then disappeared and a horizontally peripheral target stimulus (yellow spot, subtending â¼0.5Â°) appeared (1500 ms) at an unpredictable location on the horizontal meridian (Â±3Â°, 6Â°, or 9Â°). Participants were instructed to refrain from looking at the stimulus when it appeared but instead move their eyes to its mirror location. Target location was randomized within each run. During the VGS trials, participants were presented with a green fixation cross (1500 ms) which instructed them to look toward the peripheral stimulus when it appeared. No incentive cue was provided for VGS trials. The VGS trials were randomly interspersed between the AS trials to minimize the possibility that participants would establish an inhibitory response set (Velanova et al., 2009), but were not further analyzed. As indicated in previous studies, (Ollinger et al., 2001b and Ollinger et al., 2001a), the inter-trial fixation period was jittered between intervals of 1.5, 3, or 4.5 s (uniformly distributed) and consisted of participants simply fixating a central white cross on a black background. Participants performed three functional runs of the task (5 min 2 s each in duration) for a total of 30 reward AS trials, 30 neutral AS trials and 15 VGS trials."

Subjects had to learn one of three key responses for each of the 18 stimuli. In the &#34;flat&#34; condition, the 18 stimuli to 3 responses mapping was arbitrary, requiring subjects to individually learn each of the 18 associations. In a hierarchical condition, the colored borders indicated whether &#34;orientation&#34; or &#34;shape&#34; determined the response. This simplifies performance if subjects learn this hierarchical structure."

29,Wechsler Memory Scale Fourth Edition,,,trm_4b94b12bf0eb2,"Areas of Assessment

Updated Test Structure

The WMS-IV has had significant changes to the overall test structure. Based on feedback from customers, we are introducing four new subtests and modifying three existing subtests.

4 subtests were added:

    * Spatial Addition
    * Symbol Span
    * Design Memory
    * General Cognitive Screener

3 subtests retained with modifications:

    * Logical Memory
      Although the stories remain the same as seen in WMS-III for ages 16-69 years old, the repetition trial for Story B has been dropped to increase the consistency with previous editions. For the older age range of 65-90 years old, a new story was developed with content more relevant. The story is shorter and repeated once to enable adequate floor through age 90. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.
    * Verbal Paired Associates
      It now includes a combination of difficult and easy items. For the younger age group (16-69 years) there are 14 items of which 10 are hard. For the older age group (65-90 years), there are 10 items of which six are hard. Delayed Free Recall Trial has been added while Recognition Trial has increased its level of difficulty. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.
    * Visual Reproduction
      While following the same structure and format as seen in WMS-III, there have been a few changes to the subtest. Recognition Trial has been shortened and scoring has been improved. Based on Munro Cullumâs research, scoring is easier and faster than previously experienced and emphasizes recall with less focus on drawing accuracy. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.

8 subtests were eliminated:

    * Information & Orientation
    * Spatial Span
    * Mental Control
    * Faces
    * Digit Span
    * Family Pictures
    * Letter Number
    * Word List (CVLT-II can be entered int"

The participant&#39;s task is to indicate whether each stimulus is old or new. Responses in recognition memory tests are commonly sorted into four classes: Hits (&#34;old&#34; response to an old stimulus), Misses (&#34;new&#34; response to an old stimulus), False Alarms (&#34;old&#34; response to a new stimulus), and Correct Rejections (&#34;new&#34; response to a new stimulus). By comparing the percentage of responses that fall into each of these classes, the experimenter can assess both a participant&#39;s ability to discriminate between old and new stimuli, and his or her tendency to provide a particular response regardless of the type of stimulus presented. In many recognition memory tests, each old/new judgment is followed by a prompt asking participants to indicate either how confident they are in that old/new judgment, or what type of subjective experience was elicited by the stimulus being judged (e.g., was the old/new judgment accompanied by a vivid recollection of the encoding experience). This additional information can be used to generate and test more precise hypotheses about how recognition memory decisions are made.

Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) is a specific recognition memory test included in the CANTAB. The participant is presented with a series of 12 visual patterns, one at a time, in the centre of the screen. These patterns are designed so that they cannot easily be given verbal labels. In the recognition phase, the participant is required to choose between a pattern they have already seen and a novel pattern. In this phase, the test patterns are presented in the reverse order to the original order of presentation.
This is then repeated, with 12 new patterns. The second recognition phase can be given either immediately or after a 20 minute delay."

Each number is displayed onscreen for one second and, if the subject presses a button while that number is displayed, he/she receives that number of points along with immediate positive visual and auditory feedback.  When a 40 or 80 appears, however, there is a chance that it will appear in an alternate color, along with immediate negative feedback signaling a loss of 40 or 80 points, respectively.  When this occurs, the trial ends immediately (i.e. the subject may not make a response). "

    * working memory and executive function,
    * visual memory,
    * attention and reaction time (RT),
    * semantic/verbal memory,
    * decision making and response control.

The CANTAB endeavours to import the accuracy and rigour of computerised psychological testing whilst retaining the wide range of ability measures demanded of a neuropsychological battery. It is suitable for young and old subjects, and aims to be culture and language independent through the use of non-verbal stimuli in the majority of the tests."
240,Corsi Blocks,,,trm_4da881dace79c,"was developed in the early 1970s as a visuospatial counterpart to the verbal-memory span task (Milner, 1971). Over the years, it has frequently been used to assess visuospatial short-term memory performance in adults (e.g. Smyth & Scholey, 1992), children (e.g. Orsini, Schiappa, & Grossi, 1981), and patients with neuropsychological deficits (e.g. Vilkki & Holst, 1989). 

The original Corsi apparatus consisted of a set of nine identical blocks (3 X 3 X 3 cm) irregularly positioned on a wooden board (23 X 28 cm). The experimenter points to a series of blocks at a rate of one block per second. Subsequently, the participant is required to point to the same blocks in their order of presentation. The length of the block sequences increases until recall is no longer correct. 

Numerous variations have since been employed in both display characteristics (e.g. colour, number and size of the blocks, block placement, size of the board) and test administration (e.g. presentation rate, block sequences, recall order, scoring technique) (for a review, see Berch, Krikorian, & Huha, 1998)."

The test begins with a number of coloured squares (boxes) being shown on the screen. The aim of this test is that, by touching the boxes and using a process of elimination, the participant should find one blue âtokenâ in each of a number of boxes and use them to fill up an empty column on the right hand side of the screen. The number of boxes is gradually increased, until it is necessary to search a total of eight boxes.

394,Spatial Recognition Memory,(SRM),,trm_50f733d7305a1,"This is a test of visual spatial recognition memory in a 2-choice forced discrimination paradigm. This test is often used, in conjunction with Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) , before the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, as both these tests help to train the participant for PAL. PRM and SRM contain different elements of PAL and the results considered together help to decide on the exact nature of the cognitive deficit being considered. The participant is presented with a white square, which appears in sequence at five different locations on the screen. In the recognition phase, the participant sees a series of five pairs of squares, one of which is in a place previously seen in the presentation phase.

Once each stimulus appears, participants update the appropriate mental count and then press a key to proceed to the next trial. Garavanâs central ï¬nding was that the reaction times signaled by the key press were longer when the incremented counter was different from the counter incremented on the previous trial (a switch trial) than when the same counter was incremented again (a no-switch trial). Garavan interpreted this switchâno-switch reaction time (RT) difference (the ââswitching effectââ) as an index of the time required to switch attention
from one internal counter to another, suggesting that the internal focus of attention was limited in capacity. "

407,attention bias,dot-probe,,trm_50df0d8dc717b,"Attention bias refers to the tendency for an emotional stimulus to influence attention.  The term is most typically used to refer to biases related to emotional content, typically in bottom-up-capture attention tasks.  "
408,Incidental encoding task,,,trm_50df0dd9d0b6f,A task in which the subject is creating new memories without purposely knowing that memorization is the task at hand.  Their memories are created thorough working in their environment and picking up information in the process.  
409,Space Fortress,,,trm_50df1c0d946b8,"The Space Fortress videogame is used as a platform for investigating skill learning. The game was originally developed by cognitive psychologists at the University of Illinois, as a tool to study learning and training strategies. Notably, it is one of the few cognitive training tools that has shown transfer of training to real-world performance. Flight students that trained on Space Fortress performed better on a battery of real-world flight tests, and were more likely to be selected to pursue pilot training compared to a no-training control group. Studies have also found that learning Space Fortress with a strategy that involves flexibly shifting attention to different aspects of the game results in improved learning. Thus, the Space Fortress game serves as a great tool for studying how the brain acquires new, complex skills, and how the trained ability can extend to new contexts.

411,Emotion Recognition Task,(ERT),,trm_50f734f86b11a,"ERT measures the ability to identify emotions in facial expressions. The participant is shown a series of faces which appear on the screen briefly and asked to identify the emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise and fear). One hundred and eighty stimuli, which are computer morphed images derived from the facial features of real individuals each showing a specific emotion, are displayed on the screen, one at a time, in two blocks of ninety. Each face is displayed for a short while (200ms) and then immediately covered up, and then six buttons are displayed, each describing an emotion which could be portrayed in the photograph. The participant must decide which is the appropriate button to describe the emotion and touch the button. There are fifteen different photographs for each of the six emotions, each showing different levels of intensity."
412,Visual Analogue Scales,(VAS),,trm_50f7370ace495,"Visual Analogue Scales are psychometric response scales which can be used as a measurement instrument for subjective states. The CANTAB VAS assess subjective measurements of drug effect, energy levels, sickness, alertness and mood. The participant must respond to sixteen questions as they appear on the screen by touching the on-screen slider and moving it to the appropriate position on the scale."
413,Information Sampling Task,(IST),,trm_50f73d557c967,"The Information Sampling Task (IST) tests impulsivity and decision making. The participant is presented with a 5x5 array of grey boxes on the screen, and two larger coloured panels below these boxes. The participant is instructed that they are playing a game for points, which they can win by making a correct decision about which colour is in the majority under the grey boxes. They must touch the grey boxes one at a time, which open up to reveal one of the two colours shown at the bottom of the screen. Once a box has been touched, it remains open. When the participant has made their decision about which colour is in the majority, they must touch the panel of that colour at the bottom of the screen to indicate their choice. After the participant has indicated their choice, all the remaining grey boxes on the screen reveal their colours and a message is displayed to inform the participant whether or not they were correct. The colours change from trial to trial. At the end of a trial the grey boxes are displayed on the screen again at a speed which depends on how fast the trial was completed, so that there is always at least 30 seconds between trials.

There are two conditions â the fixed win condition, in which the subject is awarded 100 points for a correct decision regardless of the number of boxes opened, and the decreasing win condition, in which the number of points that can be won for a correct decision starts at 250 and decreases by 10 points for every box touched. In either condition, an incorrect decision costs 100 points."
414,NIH Toolbox Words-in Noise Test,WIN,,trm_50eb0a01bfd05,"This test was developed by Dr. Richard Wilson to measure a personâs ability to recognize single words presented amid varying levels of background noise.  It measures how much difficulty a person might have hearing in a noisy environment. A recorded voice instructs the participant to listen to and then repeat words. The task becomes increasingly difficult as the background noise gets louder. The best score that can be attained (35 correct) for either ear is -2.0 dB S/N, and the worst score (0 correct) is 26.0 dB S/N. Lower scores, therefore, are indicative of better performance on this test."
415,NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test,TPVT,,trm_50eb0dc6668e1,"This measure of receptive vocabulary is administered in a computerized adaptive format. That is, the next question a participant receives depends on his/her response to the previous question; Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) ensures a test that is tailored to the participantâs needs. The respondent is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographic images on the computer screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. "
416,NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test,DCCS,,trm_50eb115b6c476,"DCCS is a measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures 
(e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). âSwitchâ trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. For example, after four straight trials matching on shape, the participant may be asked to match on color on the next trial and then go back to shape, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus."
417,NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test,List Sorting,,trm_50eb17385e9a6,"The List Sorting test requires immediate recall and sequencing of different visually and orally presented stimuli. Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with accompanying audio recording and written text (e.g., âelephantâ), and the participant is asked to say the items back in size order from smallest to largest, first within a single dimension (either animals or foods, called 1-List) and then on two dimensions (foods, then animals, called 2-List)."
418,NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test,oral reading,,trm_50eb3b2d1de11," Separate but parallel reading tests have been developed in English and Spanish. In either language, the participant is asked to read and pronounce letters and words as accurately as possible. The test administrator scores them as right or wrong. For the youngest children, the initial items require them to identify letters (as opposed to symbols) and to identify a specific letter in an array of four symbols."
419,NIH Toolbox Oral Symbol Digit Test,,,trm_50eb461d446e1,"In this test, a coding key with nine abstract symbols is presented â each paired with a number between 1 and 9. Participants are asked to orally indicate which numbers go with symbols that are presented in a long string on the computer screen. The participant is given 120 seconds to call out as many numbers that go with the corresponding symbols as he/she can â without skipping any. This test is administered to ages 8-85 and takes approximately three minutes. The Oral Symbol Digit Test is a measure of processing speed. It can be administered as an accommodation in place of the Pattern Comparison processing Speed Test for those with significant motor limitations in the upper extremities."
420,NIH Toolbox 9-Hole Pegboard Dexterity Test,,,trm_50eb4d3d96ff8,This simple test of manual dexterity records the time required for the participant to accurately place and remove nine plastic pegs into a plastic pegboard. The protocol includes one practice and one timed trial with each hand. Raw scores are recorded as time in seconds it takes the participant to complete the task with each hand (separate score for each).
421,NIH Toolbox Grip Strength Test,,,trm_50eb51c2cd9fe,"This protocol is adapted from the grip strength testing protocol of the American Society of Hand Therapy. Participants are seated in a chair with their feet touching the ground. With the elbow bent to 90 degrees and the arm against the trunk, wrist at neutral, participants squeeze the Jamar Plus Digital dynamometer as hard as they can for a count of three. The dynamometer provides a digital reading of force in pounds. A practice trial at less than full force and one test trial are completed with each hand."
422,NIH Toolbox Standing Balance Test,,,trm_50eb54d78841b,"The Standing Balance Test is a measure developed to assess static standing balance. It involves the participant assuming and maintaining up to five poses for 50 seconds each. The sequence of poses is: eyes open on a solid surface, eyes closed on a solid surface, eyes open on a 18 foam surface, eyes closed on a foam surface, eyes open in tandem stance on a solid surface. Detailed stopping rules are in place to ensure participant safety with these progressively demanding poses. Postural sway is recorded for each pose using an accelerometer that the participant wears at waist level."
423,NIH Toolbox 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed Test ,,,trm_50eb585f62f24,"This test is adapted from the 4-meter walk test in the Short Physical Performance Battery.  Participants are asked to walk a short distance (four meters) at their usual pace. Participants complete one practice and then two timed trials. Raw scores are recorded as the time in seconds required to walk 4 meters on each of the two trials, with the better trial used for scoring. "
424,NIH Toolbox 2-Minute Walk Endurance Test,,,trm_50eb69a57bc96,This test is adapted from the American Thoracic Societyâs 6-Minute Walk Test Protocol. This test measures sub-maximal cardiovascular endurance by recording the distance that the participant is able to walk on a 50-foot (out and back) course in two minutes. The participantâs raw score is the distance in feet and inches walked in two minutes.
425,NIH Toolbox Hearing Threshold Test,,,trm_50f374718a91c,"This automated audiometric test measures hearing thresholds at six different frequencies, separately in the left and right ears. The frequencies presented are: .5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz. On each trial, the participantâs task is to detect whether a pure tone was presented via headphones by answering yes (tone heard) or no (tone not heard). Catch trials are administered to detect false-alarm responses (cases where the participant says âyesâ when no tone was presented)."
426,NIH Toolbox Hearing Handicap Inventory,,,trm_50f37767e2958,"This is the screening version of the Hearing Handicap Inventory; different versions are presented for adults (ages 18-64) and the elderly (ages 65+). Both versions are 10-item self-report measures of hearing-related disability that have been widely used in hearing research. Each of the ten items has three response options. Each item has three response options, assigned point values of 0, 2 or 4, with higher scores indicative of more of a self-reported problem for each item. The score provided for the test is thus a total summed score, ranging from 0-40."
427,NIH Toolbox Taste Intensity Test,,,trm_50f379c6c9ea9,"This test measures the perceived intensity of quinine (a bitter tastant) and salt administered in liquid solutions. The tastants are each applied to the tip of the tongue as well as swished around in the whole mouth and are rated on a generalized labeled magnitude scale (gLMS). The gLMS is a measure of perceived intensity, with seven anchor labels provided (Strongest imaginable, Very strong, Strong, Moderate, Weak, Barely detectable, No sensation). Participants can rate their intensity by clicking with a computer mouse on any point on the scale from Strongest imaginable to No sensation. The computer records the exact location of the response. A score from 0-100 on a semi-logarithmic scale is produced for each of the four items (quinine whole mouth, salt whole mouth, quinine tip of tongue, salt tip of tongue), corresponding to the point on the gLMS where the participant clicked. A higher score represents greater perceived intensity of the tastant. "
428,NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test,,,trm_50f37caf81432,"This test directly measures participantsâ visual acuity or distance vision. The participant is seated 12.5 feet away from a computer monitor at eye level, and letters (called âoptotypesâ) are displayed one at a time on the screen for the participant to identify, using both eyes at the same time, with the participant wearing his/her normal corrective lenses for distance vision (glasses or contact lenses), if worn. As the participant successfully identifies optotypes of a given size, smaller ones appear on the screen, until the computer program ascertains the smallest-size optotype the participant can successfully see. Conversely, the program displays larger optotypes if the participant cannot see the size that is first displayed, until a size that he/she can accurately see is found. For participants ages 3-7, only the letters H, O, T and V are used, and children may point to a laminated card showing the letters if they cannot verbalize or recall the letter names. For participants ages 8 and above, the entire set of optotypes is used, following a common protocol used in professional vision testing. This is the standard binocular visual acuity measure scored in LogMAR units."
429,NIH Toolbox Vision-Related Quality of Life Survey,,,trm_50f37f231aa4c,"This Toolbox Supplemental measure assesses an individualâs self-reported quality of life related to visual function in six different areas: color vision, distance vision, near vision, ocular symptoms, psycho-social and role performance. The participant responds to 53 questions, most of which start with, âHow much,â âTo what extent,â or âHow much of a problem,â choosing from a list of answer options ranging from âNot difficult at allâ to âVery difficult.â"
430,NIH Toolbox Dynamic Visual Acuity Test,DVA,,trm_50f38098952cb,"This test is a measure of gaze stability during head movement, which helps identify individuals who may have a deficit of the vestibular system (which regulates internal balance). First, the NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test must be administered, followed by the DVA Test. Participants are again seated 12.5 feet from a computer monitor at eye level. For the DVA Test, participants wear lightweight headgear that contains a rate sensor and are asked to move the head back and forth, as if indicating âno.â Once the head is measured to be moving at greater than 180 degrees per second by the rate sensor, an optotype flashes on the monitor, and the participant is asked to identify it. As with the Visual Acuity Test, only the letters H, O, T and V are used for ages 3-7, while ages 8+ use the entire letter set. Smaller optotypes are displayed as the participant correctly identifies letters, and larger ones are displayed if the participant cannot correctly identify the letter shown, until the computer has calculated the smallest size that the participant can see with the head moving. This is calculated separately for head rotation leftward and rightward from center (though the participant continues shaking the head both ways), and this performance is compared to the participantâs visual acuity when the head was stationary (the NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test score, sometimes referred to as âstaticâ visual acuity in the context of the DVA test). The difference between static and dynamic visual acuity represents the vestibular contribution to gaze stability. DVA scoring, as with visual acuity, is based in LogMAR units"
431,NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test,,,trm_50f383e76e03b,"This task assesses a personâs ability to identify various odors. Participants use scratch-andsniff cards and after scratching them one at a time, are asked to identify which of four pictures on the computer screen matches the odor they have just smelled. Participants ages 10-85 are administered nine odor cards, while those ages 3-9 are administered five odor cards. Child participants (ages 3-9 years) are first asked to identify the eight pictures used as answer choices to ensure they can complete the task. Having identified the pictures, they are asked if they have tasted or smelled the objects or foods depicted."
432,NIH Toolbox Pain Intensity Survey,,,trm_50f385a8269ce,"This measure consists of a single item measuring immediate (i.e., acute) pain in adults. It asks a participant to rate level of pain experienced âover the last seven days.â The single item is simply scored on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing no pain, and 10 representing the âworst imaginable pain.â"
433,NIH Toolbox Pain Interference Survey,,,trm_50f3862422509,This brief self-report scale measures the degree to which pain interferes with other activities in life in adults. Pain interference items were developed as part of the NIH PROMIS. Each item administered has a 5-point scale with options ranging from ânot at allâ to âvery muchâ on questions about how much pain interferes with aspects of oneâs life. The survey is scored using IRT methods.
434,NIH Toolbox Positive Affect Survey,,,trm_50f3bc06cae36,"This self-report measure assesses both activated (i.e., happiness, joy) as well as unactivated (i.e., serenity, peace) aspects of positive affect. Affect is defined as &#34;feelings that reflect a level of pleasurable engagement with the 
environment, such as happiness, joy, excitement, enthusiasm and contentment.&#34; Each item administered has a 5-point scale with options ranging from ânot at allâ to âvery much.â Each survey is scored using IRT methods."
435,NIH Toolbox General Life Satisfaction Survey,,,trm_50f3c003327c4,"This self-report measure assesses global feelings and attitudes about one&#39;s life. A CAT is used for adults, a CAT version is used for ages 13-17, and a 5-item fixed-length form is used for ages 8-12, as well as for the parent-report version with ages 3-12. Items administered include those with both 5-point and 7-point scales, with options in each case ranging from âstrongly disagreeâ to âstrongly agree.â The self-report surveys are scored using IRT methods, whereas the parent-report version is scored as a raw sum."
436,articulatory suppression task,,,trm_50f5822624e53,A short-term memory task in which the subject must produce irrelevant speech while maintaining information in memory.
437,NIH Toolbox Meaning and Purpose Survey,,,trm_50f5bfef58abb,"This is a self-report measure administered only to ages 18-85 as a CAT. In addition, a fixed-length self-report form is available for ages 18-85 as a supplemental measure. Items administered use a 5-point scale, with options ranging from âstrongly disagreeâ to âstrongly agree,â or from ânot at allâ to âvery much.â The survey is scored using IRT methods."
438,Graded Naming Test,(GNT),,trm_50f741a965470,"The Graded Naming Test, developed by Professor Elizabeth Warrington and Dr Pat McKenna in 1980 , has been used extensively in cognitive neuropsychology. The Graded Naming Test (GNT) avoids the problem of ceiling effects in previous naming tests by having subjects name drawings of objects in ascending difficulty. Reduced efficiency in retrieving the name of an object can be the first and only indication of impaired language functioning. This test assesses object-naming ability, but is in addition graded in difficulty to allow for individual differences. This means that it may be able to detect any word-finding difficulty even in those with an extensive naming vocabulary. Currently available in UK English only (this test is culturally biased and there are no alternative versions at present)."
439,One Touch Stockings of Cambridge,(OTS),,trm_50f84bbdcfa4e,"One Touch Stockings of Cambridge is a spatial planning task which gives a measure of frontal lobe function. OTS is a variant of the Stockings of Cambridge task and places greater demands on working memory as the participant has to visualise the solution. As for SOC (Stockings of Cambridge), the participant is shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays are presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. This arrangement makes the 3-D concepts involved apparent to the participant, and fits with the verbal instructions.

There is a row of numbered boxes along the bottom of the screen. The test administrator first demonstrates to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display, and completes one demonstration problem, where the solution requires one move. The participant must then complete three further problems, one each of 2 moves, 3 moves and 4 moves.

Next the participant is shown further problems, and must work out in their head how many moves the solutions to these problems require, then touch the appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate their response."
440,Reaction Time,(RTI),,trm_50f84e8ab7af8,"Reaction Time (RTI) is a latency task with a comparative history (the five choice task) and uses a procedure to separate response latency from movement time. It is more useful than CRT or SRT where it is necessary to control for tremor. The task is divided into five stages, which require increasingly complex chains of responses. In each case, the participant must react as soon as a yellow dot appears. In some stages the dot may appear in one of five locations, and the participant must sometimes respond by using the press-pad, sometimes by touching the screen, and sometimes both."
441,Rapid Visual Information Processing,(RVP),,trm_50f8516279419,"Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) is a test of sustained attention (similar to the Continuous Performance Task) and has proved useful in many studies in which drugs are used to help develop a disease model.. It is sensitive to dysfunction in the parietal and frontal lobe areas of the brain and is also a sensitive measure of general performance. A white box appears in the centre of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits (for example, 2-4-6, 3-5-7, 4-6-8) and to register responses using the press pad."
442,match to sample visual search,(MTS),,trm_50f852c084fde,"Match to Sample Visual Search (MTS) is a matching test, with a speed/accuracy trade-off. It is a simultaneous visual search task with response latency dissociated from movement time. Efficient performance on this task requires the ability to search among the targets and ignore the distractor patterns which have elements in common with the target. This test can help to differentiate between Parkinson&#39;s disease and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and also between Lewy Body dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The participant is shown a complex visual pattern (the sample) in the middle of the screen, and then, after a brief delay, a varying number of similar patterns is shown in a circle of boxes around the edge of the screen. Only one of these boxes matches the pattern in the centre of the screen, and the participant must indicate which it is by touching it. Reaction time is measured on the basis of the release of the press-pad, which allows for its more accurate measurement."
443,Penn Conditional Exclusion Test,(PCET),,trm_50f9952c2311a,"A measure of abstraction and concept formation by hypothesis testing, where the principle shifts after its discovery is established.. Subjects decide which of 4 objects does not belong with the other 3 based on one of three sorting principles (e.g., shape, size, line thickness). Sorting principles change after 10 successive correct responses, and feedback is used to guide discovery of the principle and indicate its change. There are 4 alternate forms available. An accuracy score is calculated by multiplying the proportion of correct responses by the number of categories attained (out of 3 possible)."
444,Penn Word Memory Test,(PWMT),,trm_50f998dcbfcc8,"The Penn Word Memory Test presents 20 target words that are then mixed with 20 distractors equated for frequency, length, concreteness and low imageability. The participantâs score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils. Median response times for correct responses serves as a measure of speed. A 20 min delayed recall procedure is also administered."
445,Penn Face Memory Test,(PFMT),,trm_50f99e56117fe,"presents 20 digitized faces that are then mixed with 20 distractors equated for age, gender and ethnicity. The participantâs score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils, and median response times for correct responses serves as a measure of speed. The procedure is repeated at 20 min delay. "
446,Visual Object Learning Test ,(VOLT),,trm_50f9daf1c3834,"uses Euclidean shapes as stimuli with the same paradigm as the CNB word and face tests. The participantâs score reflects the number of correctly recognized targets and correctly rejected foils, and again median response times for correct responses serves as a measure of speed. The procedure is repeated at 20 min delay. Two forms are available for each test."

The lengths of the blocks vary (average of approximately 30 seconds), but the task was designed so that the math task blocks match the length of the story task blocks, with some additional math trials at the end of the task to complete the 3.8 minute run as needed. The story blocks present participants with brief auditory stories (5-9 sentences) adapted from Aesopâs fables, followed by a 2-alternative forcedchoice question that asks participants about the topic of the story. The example provided in the original Binder paper (p. 1466) is âFor example, after a story about an eagle that saves a man who had done him a favor, participants were asked, âWas that about revenge or reciprocity?â The math task also presents trials aurally and requires subjects to complete addition and subtraction problems. The trials present subjects with a series of arithmetic operations (e.g., âfourteen plus twelveâ), followed by âequalsâ and then two choices (e.g., âtwenty-nine or twentysixâ). Participants push a button to select either the first or the second answer. The math task is adaptive to try to maintain a similar level of difficulty across participants.

524,relational processing fMRI task paradigm,,,trm_550b5a47aa23e,"This task was adapted from the one developed by Christoff and colleagues (Smith et al. 2007). The stimuli are 6 different shapes filled with 1 of 6 different textures. In the relational processing condition, participants are presented with 2 pairs of objects, with one pair at the top of the screen and the other pair at the bottom of the screen. They are told that they should first decide what dimension differs across the top pair of objects (differed in shape or differed in texture) and then they should decide whether the bottom pair of objects also differ along that same dimension (e.g., if the top pair differs in shape, does the bottom pair also differ in shape). In the control matching condition, participants are shown two objects at the top of the screen and one object at the bottom of the screen, and a word in the middle of the screen (either âshapeâ or âtextureâ). They are told to decide whether the bottom object matches either of the top two objects on that dimension (e.g., if the word is âshapeâ, is the bottom object the same shape as either of the top two objects. For both conditions, the subject responds yes or no using one button or another. For the relational condition, the stimuli are presented for 3500 ms, with a 500 ms ITI, and there are four trials per block. In the matching condition, stimuli are presented for 2800 ms, with a 400 ms ITI, and there are 5 trials per block. Each type of block (relational or matching) lasts a total of 18 seconds. In each of the two runs of this task, there are 3 relational blocks, 3 matching blocks and 3 16-second fixation blocks.

Participants play a card guessing game where they are asked to guess the number on a mystery card (represented by a â?â) in order to win or lose money. Participants are told that potential card numbers range from 1-9 and to indicate if they think the mystery card number is more or less than 5 by pressing one of two buttons on the response box. Feedback is the number on the card (generated by the program as a function of whether the trial was a reward, loss or neutral trial) and either: 1) a green up arrow with â$1â for reward trials, 2) a red down arrow next to -$0.50 for loss trials; or 3) the number 5 and a gray double headed arrow for neutral trials. The â?â is presented for up to 1500 ms (if the participant responds before 1500 ms, a fixation cross is displayed for the remaining time), following by feedback for 1000 ms. There is a 1000 ms ITI with a â+â presented on the screen. The task is presented in blocks of 8 trials that are either mostly reward (6 reward trials pseudo randomly interleaved with either 1 neutral and 1 loss trial, 2 neutral trials, or 2 loss trials) or mostly loss (6 loss trials pseudorandomly interleaved with either 1 neutral and 1 reward trial, 2 neutral trials, or 2 reward trials).

640,Single item food choice task,,,trm_55c686e0824e8,"A task in which subjects decide for several (snack) foods, sequentially, whether they would like to eat them. In order to make the choices realistic, participants are instructed that one of the trials counts for real and that they actually receive a portion of the snack chosen in that trial at the end of the study session.

In every trial, they view one of the study stimuli (3000 ms, choice period) and subsequently indicate with a button press (1500 ms, button press period) whether they want to eat a portion of the snack or not. During the button press period the words âyesâ and ânoâ are shown left/right (randomized) on the screen. After indicating their choice, a yellow box appears around the yes or no. Participants are instructed to make their choice already during the period that the image was shown. To ensure that choices are made in direct response to the food pictures, the button press period was so short that it only allows them to locate whether they have to push the left or right button. The choice trials are interspersed with a random interval (between 2000 and 5000 ms). At the beginning, halfway (after 50 trials) and at the end an additional baseline period of 30 s is included in the task (fixation cross). 

The visual stimuli consist of 100 pictures of regularly available snack foods on plates with a grey background: 50 high energy (HE) foods (energy content in kcal/100gram: M = 419, SD = 103) and 50 low energy (LE) foods (M = 56, SD = 37). Examples of HE snacks were crisps, cookies, cakes and candies. Examples of LE snacks were grapes, apples, bananas and mixed snack salads.

641,Two item food choice task,,,trm_55c691909c580,"In this task, subjects decide for a series of binary food choice options which of the two they would like to eat. In populations with weight-concerned and dieting subjects this task is employed to investigate aspects of food-related self-control. It has also been employed in general population and non-dieters (e.g., Charbonnier et al., 2015) in a slightly adapted forms. Here the implementation of Van der Laan (2014) is described. 

In the food choice task, participants make a total of 100 choices. In every trial, a high energy (HE) (energy content in kcal/100 gram: M = 419, SD = 103) and a low energy (LE) (M = 56, SD = 37) snack are shown side by side. Participants have 3000 ms to indicate which of the two products they would most like to eat a portion of by pushing the left or right but ton of a button box. After indicating their choice, a yellow box appears around the chosen product for 500 ms. The trials are interspersed with a random interval between 2000 and 5000 ms.

To investigate response conflict during food choice participants  are required to choose between pairs of HE and LE snacks matched such (on the basis of their own tastiness ratings given in the first session) that either a self-control dilemma was posed or not. In half of the trials, LE snacks are combined with HE snacks rated two or three points higher on tastiness (Self-Control required(SC)trials), posing a self-control dilemma concerning the trade-off between immediate eating enjoyment (choosing the appealing HE snack) and weight-watching intentions (choosing the less appealing LE snack). In the other half of the trials, the LE and HE snacks are matched on tastiness (equal or Â±1 point in tastiness rating; No Self-Control required (NSC) trials), such that no trade-off between eating enjoyment and weight watching intentions is needed to choose the long-term superior LE snack.

The visual stimuli consist of 100 pictures of regularly available snack foods on plates with a grey background: 50 high energy (HE) foods (energy content in kcal/100gram: M = 419, SD = 103) and 50 low energy (LE) foods (M = 56, SD = 37).

The task cue indicates whether to respond to the colored number based on parity (odd-even), magnitude (higher-lower than 5) or color (orange-blue).  There are three different tasks, and each task has two task cues that evoke the task action.  For example, the task cue could be either parity or odd-even.  Both of these task cues indicate that the subject should judge the subsequent colored number based on whether it is an odd or even number.  "
643,Inter-dimensional/Extra-dimensional Shift Task,"IDED, IDED+reversal",,trm_5667476fc14dd,"A combination of the intradimensional task and extradimensional task. Subjects are presented with two compound stimuli, each composed of a &#39;line stimulus&#34; and a &#34;shape stimulus&#34;. Thus the stimuli are multi-dimensional, in that they are composed of two separable features (line and shape).  There are 8 different âlinesâ, and 8 different âshapesâ.  Subjects are told to choose between the two stimuli, and receive feedback on their choices.  The correct choice depends upon the current target, where the target can take on any one of the 8 âlinesâ or 8 âshapesâ.  The current target shifts after several trials.  This allows for an inter-dimensional shift, where the subject learns the new correct target within the same dimension (old target: âline 1â, new target âline 2â) or for an extra-dimensional shift, where the subject learns the new target outside of the old dimension (old target: âline 1â new target: âshape 2â)."
644,Dimensions task,,,trm_566747c3d757f,"Subjects are presented with three three-dimensional (e.g., color, texture, shape) stimuli.

One dimension (e.g., color) determines reward, and one exemplar in this dimension (e.g. &#34;red&#34;) has a higher probability of reward than the others (75% vs. 25%). If rewarded, the subject earns 1 point (the subject is instructed to maximize points). After 15-25 trials the relevant dimension and higher probability feature is switched. This switch is either signaled to the participant (in most versions so far) or not (in one paper)."
645,Probabilistic Selection Task,,,trm_5667483dcc371,"The probabilistic selection task assesses whether participants learn better from positive or negative reinforcement.  The subject is instructed to choose between abstract stimuli via key press.  The task is composed of two phases.  During the first phase, subjects learn to associate 6 abstract visual stimuli with different reward probabilities (e.g., stim 1= 80%, stim 2 = 70%, stim 3= 60%, stim 4= 40%, stim 5 = 30%, stim 6= 20%).  In phase 1, the various stimuli are always presented in pairs, where the sum of the two reward probabilities associated with each stimuli equal 100%.  For example, stim 1 will always be paired with stim 6 (80%+20%=100%).  Subjects eventually learn that for each pair, choosing one stimuli over the other results in more reward (80%>20%).  The subject is tested on this association in phase two.  During phase two, the subject must decide between novel combinations of stimuli. Each stimuli is presented with the remaining four stimuli that it was not paired with in phase 1.  For example, stim1 (80%) can be paired with either stim2(70%), stim3(60%), stim4(40%), or stim5(30%), but not with itself or with the stimuli it was associated with during phase 1, stim6 (20%). Subjects are instructed to win as many points as possible.  There is no feedback given during the second phase."

The stimuli are created using software to morph faces into differing intensities of emotion. For example, a 50  morph will be a 50  morph between a neutral face and the same identity expressing the target emotion. There are 36 trials in total, divided into happy, sad, angry, and fearful faces. Of the 36 trials, 4 show no emotional difference. The remaining 32 trials have emotion differentials in increments of 10  ranging from 10  - 60 , distributed more heavily toward 30  and 40  items. Trials are presented in random order, and the test is a forced-choice task with no time limit per trial. After the subject answers one trial, the test automatically moves to the next trial. Response time is recorded for each trial.

735,route learning,,,trm_58ab8a6131c5a,"Subjects study sets of real-world routes. For each subject, the set of routes includes (a) pairs that share a common path before diverging to terminate at distinct destinations (âoverlapping routesâ) and (b) pairs with no paths in common (ânon-overlapping routesâ) Importantly, each route contributes to both conditions. For example, âroute 1â and âroute 2â are overlapping routes, but âroute 1â and âroute 3â are non-overlapping routes. Each route contains an initial segment that is shared with another route , and a later segment, including the destination, that is route-specific. Although the real-world spatial locations of the overlapping segments are identical, the pictures for each route are taken at different times and therefore differ subtly in terms of pedestrians, vehicles, etc. Routes are studied twice per round for 14 rounds. Subjects are instructed to learn each route (i.e., the specific path to each destination) but are not told the destination at the start of the route. After each study round, subjects are shown individual pictures drawn from the routes and are asked to select the destination associated with each picture. Of central interest is accuracy for pictures drawn from Segment 1 of each route because selecting the correct destination for these pictures requires discriminating between overlapping routes.

737,Yellow Light Game,,,trm_59668f09db813,"The Yellow Light Game (YLG) is a computerized driving simulation task that was modified from the Stoplight Task (Gardner & Steinberg, 2005; Chein et al., 2011). Similar to the Stoplight Task, each run in the YLG involves participants driving on a straight road with 20 intersections, each controlled by a traffic light. Participants are instructed that the goal of the game is to get the fastest time. At each intersection, when the traffic light turns yellow, participants choose to either continue through the intersection (Go decision), or to stop the car (Stop decision); they are not able to accelerate or steer. Participants are instructed that Go decisions would result in the fastest time, unless another car is present on the cross street, in which case the participant would crash. Crashes double the time spent at an intersection compared to if the participant had decided to stop. Therefore, Go decisions are considered âriskyâ, whereas Stop decisions are considered âsafeâ. Upon completion of a run, participants are presented with their completion time and the number of crashes during that run.

A unique feature of the YLG is that there are three different types of intersections, which vary based on the timing of yellow light onset and the presence or absence of a car on the cross street. Some intersections have a 75% probability of crashing, others have a 25% probability of crashing, and the remaining intersections have a 50% probability of crashing. To prevent the task from promoting risk taking overall, the cumulative probability of crashing is set to 50% (i.e., 10 out of the 20 intersections have cars approaching on the cross street, resulting in a crash if the participant made a Go decision). This task feature is not explicitly communicated to participants, although participants have the opportunity to implicitly learn this information based on the differential timing of the yellow light onsets associated with each type of intersection. That is, intersections at which the light turns yellow earlier (i.e., when the participant was further away from the intersection) signal a greater crash probability. By including the different types of intersections, we are able to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive risk taking, without promoting risk taking overall, as the cumulative probability of crashing is 50%.

738,network traversal task,,,trm_597249e1ec9d3,"Subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli whose order is determined by a walk (e.g., Random, Eulerian, Hamiltonian) over an underlying network."
739,motorphotic,,,trm_5975f939336c0,"This task is intended to stimulate both primary visual and motor cortices.
During this task, subjects are instructed to tap their fingers (right-hand, left-hand or bilateral) on a visual cue, in the form of a black-and-white, flashing checkerboard, that appears on the screen. A fixation cross may also appear at the center of the screen to help subjects maintain their gaze."
740,Fictitious event ordering,,,trm_59cd03eeeab30,"The participant has to judge which one from two events taken from a fictitious story took place first. 
For this, the participant, need to be aware of the story.
This task probes mental Time Travel abilities.

A variant of this task consists in ordering the events in space (North/south, East/West). "
741,episodic recombination paradigm,,,trm_59ed1f7a0ac9c,"The episodic recombination paradigm (Addis et al., 2009) was designed to study episodic simulations (remembering past events, or imagining novel future events). In this paradigm, participants first provide a set of autobiographical memories, each comprised of a set of details, e.g., a person, place, and object. They later return for a separate session in which they are cued to recall some of these episodes. For the imagination trials, details concerning person, place, and object are experimentally recombined across events, and participants are asked to imagine an event that might occur in the future involving the recombined set of details. Participants press a button once they have constructed the past or future event and after that continue to simulate the event, generating as much detail as possible. This is typically followed by ratings of phenomenological characteristics of the simulated events, e.g., detail or difficulty.

742,Generalization of Instrumental Avoidance Task,,,tsk_BuPIiFcjBo2aX,"Active avoidance paradigm, probing choice behaviour (avoidance or 
non-avoidance) in the face of stimuli associated with an aversive 
reinforcer (e.g. painful electric shock; CS+s), stimuli associated with 
the ommission of the aversive reinforcer (CS-), and, additionally, 
generalization stimuli (GSs), that are individually generated for each 
participant to be 75% reliably distinguishable from adjacent CS+s (on 
the basis of a previous perceptual task), and that are not associated 
with administration of the aversive reinforcer. On each trial, one 
stimulus is presented, and the participant must decide whether to make 
an avoidance response (press a key), or remain and face the consequences 
of that stimulus. Critically, making an avoidance response is associated 
with a small cost (e.g. one additional aversive reinforcer administered 
at the end of each block for every 5 avoidance responses made during 
that block, with total responses per block recorded on a counter at the 
bottom of the screen). The optimal strategy (in order to minimise number 
of aversive reinforcers received) is therefore to make an avoidance 
response if the stimulus is a CS+, but not otherwise (participants must 
learn the identity of each stimulus through trial and error). 
Generalization of instrumental avoidance is operationalized as avoidance 
responses made on GS+ trials."
743,error awareness task,,,tsk_nzi0bkdoO8a23,"The EAT is a modified Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm providing behavioral and neural indices of both error awareness and inhibitory control. Participants are shown color words (e.g., red, blue, green) printed in congruent or incongruent fonts (as in a Stroop task) such that most stimuli are congruent (80%; e.g., the word “BLUE” in blue font). Congruent stimuli are Go trials requiring a button-press response (eg., button 1). In contrast, participants are to withhold button-presses when either the same color word is repeated on two successive trials (No-Go Rule-1) or an incongruent stimulus is presented (e.g., the word “BLUE” in red font; No-Go Rule-2). Continuously monitoring both No-Go rules is difficult and participants are predisposed to monitor for REPEAT (Rule-1) more so than INCONGRUENT trials (Rule-2). This leads to a sufficient number of errors (~45%), a portion of which remain undetected by participants (~10-20%). The task begins with words presented for 900ms followed by a 600ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). To equate task performance across groups and maintain overall errors at ~45%, task difficulty dynamically adapts based on individual performance by varying the stimulus presentation and ISI durations. Participants indicate “error awareness” by pressing a separate 'error signaling button' (e.g., button 2) on the trial following a commission error."
744,Social influence on emotion task,,,tsk_ec4xbqynlG1uR,"This task assesses how participants emotion ratings can be influenced by others. In the first session, participants are presented with images of people in negative contexts. They are asked to imagine that they are the person in the picture and indicate, on a scale from 1 (Neutral) to 10 (Very Negative), how they feel. This part of the task is self-paced. Approximately one week later, participants come back to the lab and are shown how other people (for example, ingroup and outgroup members) rated the same images (sometimes no group feedback is presented). After each feedback presentation, participants are asked to rate the images once more. In reality, group ratings are experimentally manipulated based on the participants’ initial ratings during the behavioral session. Participants are shown ratings that are higher (+2, +3, +4) and lower (-2, -3, -4) than their initial scores with an equal distribution of higher/lower scores."
745,letter matching task,,,tsk_PNUOMlNOAajsT,"Subjects must compare pairs of letters regarding exact physical identity, name identity, or categorical identity by pressing one of two response keys. These three different instructions require increasing depth of processing stimulus information which is reflected by differences in response latency. "
746,Hidden Path Learning Task,,,tsk_o32s7ULZu8ATo,"Subjects must find a pathway within a grid from a cell A to a cell B. Typically, the path starts in the upper left corner and end in the lower right corner. After successfully exploring a grid by trial and error, the task repeats with the same hidden path and subjects have to reconstruct the previously explored path. The task is considered to have a a strong learning and planning component and as such measures executive functions."
747,Compensatory Tracking Task,,,tsk_eDRFWNl1ktVsf,"A compensatory tracking task is a task that assesses eye–hand coordination, in which a user is operating a display that has an indicator and a zero point using a joystick, computer mouse, trackball, or other controlling device. The user must try to keep the indicator within the zero point while the indicator is being acted upon by outside forces."
748,Pursuit Tracking Task,,,tsk_GdteOhkqZJLYg,"A pursuit tracking task is a task that assesses eye–hand coordination, in which a user is operating a display that has an indicator controlled by a computer mouse, trackball, or other controlling device. The user must try to keep the indicator on a moving trail or road with or without preview. "
749,Continuous Tapping Task,,,tsk_zaClbCwuCeWt2,"In a continuous tapping task, subjects must tap as quick as possible one key for a one minute test period. You can introduce different treatments by instruction, e.g. comfortable speed vs max speed, dominant vs non-dominant hand"
750,Non-instrumental information seeking task,,,tsk_xFpgex9zOvlOu,"In this task, participant play lotteries with gain and loss blocks. On gain trials they either win $1 or $0. On loss trials they either lose $1 or $0. The probability of winning or losing varies from trial to trial from 0.1 to 0.9 and is explicitly displayed in the form of a pie chart. The participants' task is to indicate whether they would like to reveal the outcome of the lottery or not, by selecting between two offers, each representing a different probability of having the outcome revealed. Whether they receive information about the outcome of the lottery or not is non-instrumental because the outcome of all lotteries are added to the participant's final payment, regardless of whether information was obtained. Therefore, information about the outcome of each lottery had no bearing on participants' actual earnings.
After selecting the offer (high or low probability of receiving information), participants are presented with a green knowledge cue, indicating that the outcome of the lottery is about to be shown to them ('WIN', 'ZERO' or 'LOSS'), or with a red ignorance cue, indicating that a non-informative outcome cue would follow ('XXXX'). Color associations are counterbalanced across participants."
751,Remote Associates Test,,,tsk_ZMTNk4Oce5b2j,"Originally developed by Mednick (Mednick SA. 1968. Remote associates test. J Creat Behav.<br>2:213–214), the Remote Associates Test (RAT) asks examinees to look at 3 words, which are not obviously related by a single concept, and generate a 4th word that is related to all 3.  An example: putting, bean, envy are the stimulus words, and a correct answer is ""green"".<br><br>From Wikipedia: <br>The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a creativity test used to determine a human's creative potential. The test typically lasts forty minutes and consists of thirty to forty questions each of which consists of three common stimulus words that appear to be unrelated. The person being tested must think of a fourth word that is somehow related to each of the first three words.[1] Scores are calculated based on the number of correct questions.<br><br>"
752,Reciprocal Artwork Evaluation Task,,,tsk_zcuAj6VrsFmfV,This task is to measure how a participant's evaluation about a current partner's artwork is biased by the social feedback (regarding one's won artwork) from the current partner and previous partners. This task is for measuring self-protective motivation when receiving constant social evaluations. See Yoon et al (2018) https://rdcu.be/35Tm
753,prospective sequential decision making task,,,tsk_VokAidevRX1Vs,"Decision making task in which participants compare an offer with a set of alternatives with varying values and probabilities. Participants are given variable 'search horizons' i.e. attempts to get a new offer from the set of alternatives. In order to make optimal decisions participants need to reason prospectively, i.e. take into account future states. In other words, they need to plan a potential sequence of decisions. "
